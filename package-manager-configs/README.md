The files in this [package-manager-configs](.) folder should be deployed 
to the associated repository.
The deployment of these files is a one-time operation.
These files make it easier for users to set up their local machine to use our installer repositories.

Production: The [production](nx-prod) files have been deployed to [repo.sonatype.com](https://repo.sonatype.com)
in the `community-hosted` raw repository.
